# RFC-Prem-Match-Winner-ML

Predicted football/soccer match winners with machine learning and python. Implemented using Pandas, scikit-learn, and Random Forrest Classifier with 68% accuracy. Created match predictors and split data into training and test sets according to dates to train the machine learning model. Improved precision using rolling average (passing in data from previous match weeks) and retained the model for better precision.
